# Rijksmix-node

[Rijksmix](http://rijksmix.herokuapp.com/) served with Node.js. Deployed with Heroku. <br>
Rijksmix breaks the script of silent engagement with visual art. Based on user input, the mashup juxtaposes paintings on display at Amsterdamâ€™s Rijskmuseum with sound pieces from Soundcloud. Resulting from the juxtaposition is a multi-sensory experience that extends across art disciplines and time.

## Built with

* [Rijksmuseum API](https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/api)
* [Soundcloud API](https://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/api/guide)
